**Theme:** Enhanced editing workflow with optional AI-powered editorial pass and improved draft preview experience.

### Added
- **Optional Editor Pass** - New phase after writing where AI polishes your article based on your style guide settings. Removes common AI writing tells, tightens prose, adds formatting (lists, bold, pull quotes), and fixes grammar. Your original is preserved as backup.
- **Working Draft Files** - As you write each section, see a clean markdown preview file instead of scrolling through chat history to review your work.
- **Editorial Decision Point** - After completing all sections, choose whether to run the editor pass for polish or skip directly to SEO and export.

### Changed
- Workflow expanded from 9 to 10 phases to accommodate the optional editor pass.
- Export now uses either your original draft or the editor-polished version, depending on your choice.
- Draft JSON now captures your initial raw idea separately from the refined topic, preserving your complete thought process.

### Fixed
- No fixes in this release.
